# Alternative: If You Can't Find Environment Variables in Lovable

## Temporary Solution (For Testing Only)

If you absolutely cannot find where to set environment variables in Lovable, here's a temporary workaround:

### Option 1: Direct File Edit in Lovable

1. In Lovable's code editor, create a new file:
   ```
   frontend/.env.production
   ```

2. Add these lines:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url_here
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key_here
   VITE_SITE_URL=https://maya-travel-agent.lovable.app
   ```

3. Save and deploy

### Option 2: Temporary Hardcode (NOT for production)

**⚠️ WARNING: Only for testing! Don't leave credentials in code!**

1. In Lovable, edit `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts`
2. Change line 11-13 from:
   ```javascript
   const getSiteUrl = () => {
     return (import.meta as any)?.env?.VITE_SITE_URL || window.location.origin
   }
   ```
   
   To:
   ```javascript
   const getSiteUrl = () => {
     // Temporary fix - replace with env vars ASAP
     return 'https://maya-travel-agent.lovable.app'
   }
   ```

3. Save and deploy

**Remember:** This is temporary! Find the proper env vars section later.

## Check Lovable's Interface

Lovable's UI might show environment variables in these places:

### Look for these icons/buttons:
- ⚙️ Gear/Settings icon
- 🔧 Configuration
- 📝 Variables
- 🔐 Secrets
- 🌍 Environment
- 🚀 Deploy Settings

### Common menu locations:
1. **Top Navigation Bar**
   - Settings
   - Project Settings
   - Configure

2. **Side Panel (Left or Right)**
   - Environment
   - Config
   - Deploy

3. **Project Dashboard**
   - Advanced
   - Build Settings
   - Deploy Config

4. **During Deployment**
   - When you click Deploy
   - Pre-deploy settings
   - Build configuration

## Still Stuck?

If none of these work:

1. **Check Lovable's documentation** at https://lovable.dev/docs
2. **Contact Lovable support** - they can show you exactly where
3. **Check if there's a `.env` file editor** in the Lovable file browser
4. **Look for "Secrets" or "Config" tabs** near the code editor
