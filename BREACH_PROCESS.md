# MVP Breach Process for Maya Trips AI

## Overview
This document outlines the incident response process for the Maya Trips AI MVP, a travel assistant application with AI integration, payment processing, and multi-platform support.

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Preparation
- **1.1** Establish incident response team with designated roles (Lead, Technical, Communications)
- **1.2** Document contact information and escalation procedures
- **1.3** Prepare communication templates for stakeholders, users, and authorities
- **1.4** Set up monitoring tools for logs, API calls, and system health
- **1.5** Identify critical assets: Supabase database, Stripe payment data, Z.ai API keys, Telegram bot tokens
- **1.6** Maintain up-to-date backups of database and configurations
- **1.7** Conduct regular security training and drills

### 2. Identification
- **2.1** Monitor alerts from security tools (npm audit, GitHub security alerts)
- **2.2** Review application logs for suspicious activity (backend logs, Supabase audit logs)
- **2.3** Check for unauthorized API calls to Z.ai GLM-4.6 or Stripe
- **2.4** Verify user reports of unusual behavior
- **2.5** Assess potential data exposure (user data, payment info, AI conversations)
- **2.6** Determine breach scope and impact level

### 3. Containment
- **3.1** Isolate affected systems (shutdown compromised services if necessary)
- **3.2** Disable compromised user accounts and API keys
- **3.3** Block malicious IP addresses at firewall level
- **3.4** Temporarily suspend Telegram bot and WhatsApp integration if involved
- **3.5** Preserve evidence: take screenshots, log exports, memory dumps
- **3.6** Notify incident response team and escalate to leadership

### 4. Eradication
- **4.1** Remove any malware or backdoors from affected systems
- **4.2** Rotate all compromised credentials (API keys, database passwords, bot tokens)
- **4.3** Patch identified vulnerabilities in frontend, backend, or dependencies
- **4.4** Clean affected data in Supabase if contaminated
- **4.5** Update security configurations (CORS, rate limiting, input validation)
- **4.6** Verify eradication with security scans

### 5. Recovery
- **5.1** Restore systems from clean backups
- **5.2** Test all functionalities (AI chat, payments, Telegram integration)
- **5.3** Gradually re-enable services with monitoring
- **5.4** Communicate recovery status to stakeholders
- **5.5** Monitor for any recurrence of the incident
- **5.6** Restore user access and data where appropriate

### 6. Lessons Learned
- **6.1** Document the full incident timeline and actions taken
- **6.2** Conduct post-mortem meeting with all involved parties
- **6.3** Identify root causes and preventive measures
- **6.4** Update security policies and procedures
- **6.5** Implement additional monitoring or controls
- **6.6** Provide training to prevent similar incidents

## Communication Guidelines
- Internal: Immediate notification to team via Slack/Email
- Users: Transparent communication about impact and resolution
- Authorities: Report if personal data or payments affected (GDPR, PCI compliance)
- Partners: Notify Stripe, Z.ai, Telegram if their systems involved

## Tools and Resources
- Monitoring: Application logs, Supabase dashboard, Stripe dashboard
- Security: npm audit, GitHub security tab, firewall logs
- Backup: Supabase backups, configuration files
- Communication: Email templates, incident tracking spreadsheet

This process should be reviewed quarterly and updated as the application evolves.
